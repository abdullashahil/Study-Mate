# StudyMate

**StudyMate** is an online learning hub that provides a platform for learners to connect and collaborate based on their specific areas of interest. It offers a unique experience for those wishing to learn new topics through online conversations, with dedicated rooms (groups) focused on various subjects. StudyMate encourages knowledge sharing, discussion, and community-driven learning, allowing users to easily find and join rooms that match their learning interests.

For example, if you are a beginner in JavaScript, you can join the "JS Beginner" room in StudyMate.
